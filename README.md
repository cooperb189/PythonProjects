# üêç Python Mini Projects

This repo holds a bunch of small Python projects I built to level up my skills. Each one focuses on a specific concept like regex, file handling, user input validation, or basic user interaction. Nothing super fancy‚Äîjust solid, practical practice that helped me build real understanding.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside

### 1. **Agent Decoder**
- Extracts emails and phone numbers from messy text.
- Redacts agent names and secret codes.
- Regex practice, string formatting, and data extraction all in one.

### 2. **Client Database**
- Pulls valid contact info from a client data dump.
- Cleans and normalizes UK phone numbers.
- Filters out dodgy or malformed emails and numbers.

### 3. **Grocery List Manager**
- CLI tool to add, update, remove, and check items in a shopping list.
- Shows how to use dictionaries, loops, and user input cleanly.
- Basic structure for CRUD-style programs.

### 4. **Recruitment List Cleaner**
- Tidies up a messy recruitment log.
- Extracts and deduplicates contact info.
- Ignores bad data and formats everything consistently.

### 5. **Temperature Converter**
- Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Menu-driven, uses reusable functions and PyInputPlus for clean input handling.

### 6. **User Login Setup**
- Builds a CLI-based login system.
- Validates full name, email, username, and strong passwords.
- Stores user credentials in separate `.txt` files using `Path`, `os`, and regex.
- Great practice for input validation, file I/O, and small-scale data storage.

### 7. **Simple Calculator**
- CLI calculator that supports chained operations (+, -, x, /).
- Handles user input errors with retries and graceful exits.
- Combines control flow, functions, and modular arithmetic logic.

### 8. **File Manager**
- View folder contents, delete, copy, or move files/folders.
- Organize Python files or clean up directories.
- Uses `shutil`, `os`, `Path`, and `send2trash` for real-world file management.
- Menu-driven and interactive‚Äîgreat mix of everything from automation to CLI work.

# Python Mini Projects

This repo holds a bunch of small Python projects I built to level up my skills. Each project is focused on something specificâ€”regex, file handling, input validation, 
or basic user interaction. Nothing too fancy, but all solid practice.

## What's Inside

1. **Agent Decoder**
- Pulls out emails and phone numbers from a block of messy text.
- Redacts agent names and secret codes.
- Regex practice, string formatting, and data extraction all in one.

2. **Client Database**
- Extracts valid contact info from client data.
- Cleans up and normalizes phone numbers into a standard UK format.
- Filters out dodgy or incomplete emails and numbers.

3. **Grocery List Manager**
- CLI tool for adding, updating, removing, and checking items in a shopping list.
- Basic use of dictionaries, loops, error handling, and user input.

4. **Recruitment List Cleaner**
- Cleans a messy recruitment log.
- Extracts and deduplicates phone numbers and email addresses.
- Skips bad data and standardizes formatting.

5. **Temperature Converter**
- Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Simple menu-driven app with reusable functions.
- Uses PyInputPlus for better input handling.

## Why I Made These

I'm currently learning Python and wanted to get hands-on with real tasks instead of just following tutorials. These projects helped me build confidence in:
- Regular expressions
- Input validation
- Data cleaning
- Control flow
- Structuring small programs

## Next Up

I'll be jumping into file handling, web scraping, and working with CSV/JSON data next. Eventually aiming to automate boring stuff and maybe even start building tools for others.
